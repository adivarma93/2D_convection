This repository contains a 2D thermal convection solver implemented in Python. The code simulates Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection in a rectangular box using the vorticity-streamfunction formulation with finite difference methods. 
I have uploaded both the serial and parallelized versions. It used Numba for Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and MPI for parallel execution.
